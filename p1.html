 Mobile computing is human computer interaction in which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, Voice and video. Mobile computing involves mobile communication,mobile hard ware and mobile software.Mobile computing is the set of IT technologies, products, services, and operational strategies and procedures that enable end users to gain access to computation, information, and related resources and capabilities while mobile. Mobile most commonly refers to access in motion and is therefore unrestricted to a given geographic location.
 <p>Mobile may also, however, refer to access in a fixed location via equipment that users can relocate as required, but is stationary while in operation. This mode of operation is often called nomadic computing..</p>
